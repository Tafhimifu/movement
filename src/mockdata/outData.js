{"title":"ZZ Plant","image":"https://i.imgur.com/oyYDgPr.jpg","attribute":"ZZ plant, with its wide, attractive, dark green leaves, boasts many favorable traits for offices and homes. ZZ plant tolerates neglect, is drought tolerant, and accepts low-light conditions without throwing a fit. Its waxy, smooth leaves reflect sunlight and brighten rooms. ZZ usually grows slowly to a height and width of two to three feet so it is not a plant monster that outgrows containers quickly.ZZ plant also is an air purifier and in a NASA study, researchers found it is specifically adept at removing copious amounts of toxins such as xylene, toluene, and benzene from the air","care":"ZZ plants require less water than a lot of plants, so if you tend to neglect yours (rather than overwater them) you'll do well with this one. It'll thrive in bright, indirect light—but it can also tolerate low light if you have a less-than-sunny spot you want to keep it in, according to Bloomscape."},

{"title":"Rubber Plants","image":"https://i.imgur.com/MZYXJMk.jpg","attribute":"Rubber trees, formally ficus elastica, can be enjoyed as either medium-sized house plants or grown to become focal point, beautiful indoor trees. If you’re patient enough to grow your own, plants that start out younger when you buy them adapt better to indoor living than starting with a more mature plant. They can grow to impressive heights within a few years, especially if you put the plants outside during the summer. Keeping the plants in small pots will restrict their growth, if you want to keep them smaller.","care":"Like most of the other plants on this list, the rubber plant requires bright, indirect light. You should only water it when the soil is dry. Rubber plants have the added benefit of being one of the best natural air-cleaners out there. Place them near your favorite seating area to enjoy fresh air."},
{"title":"String of Pearls","image":"https://i.imgur.com/HQCVI2h.jpg","attribute":"String of pearls plants are unique vining succulents that are easily recognizable by their tiny pea-shaped leaves. The leaves grow on trailing stems that gracefully spill over the sides of planters and hanging baskets. You can use these stems to propagate the plant, which is a robust and quick grower—gaining about 5 to 15 inches per year—but does not live long without propagation.","care":"You'll quickly have lengthy strands of pearls by leaving this plant in bright, indirect light with enough water to keep the soil steadily moist. Put yours in a hanging pot that allows the succulent's vines to cascade over the sides."},
